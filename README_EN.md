## Switch Language:
**English** | [简体中文](README.md)

## Mod content:

*Before we start, you should **know something about China Railway's rolling stocks or equipments**.   
[Rail Transport in China (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_transport_in_China)

### Ticketing System
Lead Beyond has introduced interactive content like cards, tickets, turnstiles, etc.  
We will also introduce the TRS System and allow you to buy counted tickets manually soon.

### Blocks
Knowing how hard it is to decorate trains in such small room, we have added several blocks allow you to decorate your trains' interior.

### Planned New Features in 0.2.0:
- MTR-like new station management system while expanding its interaction with Create's own station system.
- Redesign the ticketing system
- Train route map generated via train schedules
- New and compact display screens to replace Create's ones
- Completely move the project structure to use Architectury

## Compatibility
This mod depends on Create to work. Though, it's also possible to use it with MTR (and maybe RTM if that mod updates to 1.18.2)
