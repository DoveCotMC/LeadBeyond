<img src="src/main/resources/icon.png" width = "200" height = "200" alt="Logo" align=right />

***Note: This mod is at the very early stages of development, with almost NOTHING, and may have a SIGNIFICANT TIME LAG between release and code resources. Please consider carefully whether you decide to use this mod NOW.***

## Switch Language:
**English** | [简体中文](README.md)

## Mod content:

*Before we start, you should **know something about China Railway's rolling stocks or equipments[^0]**. Take a glance at footnotes if you have any trouble in understanding these elements. (Some need to be translated manually)*

### Ticket System
Lead Beyond has introduced interactive content like cards, tickets, turnstiles, etc.

### Blocks
Knowing how hard it is to decorate trains in such small room, we have added:

- RZ Seat of CR 25T Coach[^1][^2]
- YZ Double Seat in single and double directions[^3]
- CR Like In-car LED Display[^4]
- YW Bed (Lower/Middle) of CR 25T Coach[^5]
- YW Bed (Upper) of CR 25T Coach[^5]
- Table of CR 25T Coach
- CR Like Train Destination sign[^6]
- Passageway of two cars
- The Auto Door in the passageway of CR 25T Coach
- The Isolation Doors of CR 25T Coach
- Front/Side LED Screen
- Front Escape Door
- Headlights
- Train Doors
- Currently that's all.

At the same time there are some blocks you can use it outside：
- The green bars along the CR Lines[^7]
- Currently that's all, again.

## Compatibility
This mod depends on Create to work. Though, it's also possible to use it with MTR (and maybe RTM if that mod updates to 1.18.2)
